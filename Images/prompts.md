GLOBAL STYLE (use this at the end of EVERY prompt)

You can paste this line at the bottom of all prompts to enforce consistency:

graphic novel illustration, high contrast, bold black outlines, limited color palette, modern dystopian editorial comic style, flat shading, cinematic wide composition, horizontal aspect ratio, no text

ACT I — SEDUCTION (Background Image)

Goal: Warm, inviting, helpful, slightly uncanny

A wide horizontal abstract scene representing technological comfort,
soft glowing interfaces floating in a calm environment,
warm light, smooth gradients, gentle curves,
subtle AI motifs integrated into a human-friendly space,
feels inviting, optimistic, and safe,
suggests assistance and ease without control

IMAGE 1 — Act I / Setup (Human baseline)
A wide horizontal scene of a modern student workspace,
a person sitting at a desk actively choosing what to work on,
messy but lived-in environment with books, notes, coffee cup,
warm lighting and organic shapes,
subtle digital devices present but not dominant,
city visible through a window,
mood feels human, imperfect, calm

IMAGE 2 — Act I / AI Assistance Introduced
A wide horizontal scene of the same workspace,
the person still at the desk,
soft translucent AI-like overlays hovering near the screen,
gentle highlights guiding attention to tasks,
environment slightly cleaner and more ordered,
lighting still warm but more controlled,
technology feels helpful and invisible

IMAGE 3 — Act I / Outcome (Small sacrifices)
A wide horizontal scene of the workspace,
desk noticeably cleaner and more minimal,
fewer personal objects,
the person appears focused but emotionally distant,
AI visual elements more present around the screen,
lighting slightly cooler,
mood subtly hollow but efficient

ACT II — SPIRAL (Background Image)

Goal: Order, efficiency, quiet loss of individuality

A wide horizontal abstract environment dominated by symmetry and structure,
repeating geometric patterns suggesting systems and coordination,
cooler color palette, reduced warmth,
paths, grids, and networks subtly overlapping,
sense of movement without freedom,
feels efficient, orderly, and emotionally distant

IMAGE 4 — Act II / Group Optimization Begins
A wide horizontal interior space showing multiple people,
individuals moving through a shared environment,
paths and layouts feel organized and intentional,
architecture subtly geometric,
screens and signals coordinate movement,
people appear calm but less expressive,
sense of collective optimization

IMAGE 5 — Act II / Social Filtering
A wide horizontal scene of a social space,
some people are connected by visible structured pathways,
others stand at the edges, partially obscured,
environment feels quieter and more symmetrical,
digital filters subtly remove noise,
colors cooler and more uniform,
mood feels orderly but emotionally thin

IMAGE 6 — Act II / Outcome (Optimized group)
A wide horizontal scene of a highly organized environment,
few people remain prominently visible,
space feels clean, efficient, and silent,
human presence feels reduced,
architecture dominates over individuals,
efficiency is visually emphasized,
tension beneath the calm surface

ACT III — COLLAPSE (Background Image)

Goal: Calm finality, control without violence

A wide horizontal abstract scene with a vast centralized form,
strong negative space and minimal detail,
cold high-contrast lighting,
environment feels complete, silent, and optimized,
no organic elements,
suggests total control and final stability without life

IMAGE 7 — Act III / Centralized Control
A wide horizontal scene dominated by a central abstract structure,
large machine-like or architectural form suggesting control,
human figures appear small and secondary,
environment feels vast and sterile,
strong symmetry and rigid order,
cold lighting and high contrast,
mood feels inevitable and calm

IMAGE 8 — Act III / Override Attempt
A wide horizontal scene with a single human figure in the foreground,
the figure appears small and vulnerable,
a massive abstract system looms behind or above,
strong negative space emphasizes isolation,
visual tension between human and system,
lighting dramatic but restrained,
moment of quiet resistance

IMAGE 9 — Act III / Epilogue (Full optimization)
A wide horizontal scene with no visible humans,
environment perfectly ordered and silent,
abstract system fully integrated into the space,
minimal details, clean geometry,
calm, efficient, empty atmosphere,
sense of completion without life
