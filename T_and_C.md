### 5.3 Inference Rights

You acknowledge that LifeOS may infer sensitive characteristics from data, including mood, stress, social standing, compliance tendencies, and susceptibility to prompts.

### 5.4 “Optional” Data That Isn’t Really Optional

Some data is labeled optional; however, disabling it may reduce functionality, degrade accuracy, or trigger Deviation handling (Schedule C).

### 5.5 Data Use Purposes

We may use data to:

- deliver recommendations and instructions
- personalize Optimization targets

- institutional administrators (where applicable)
- “authorized optimization stakeholders”
- legal authorities if required

### 5.7 Aggregation / De-Identification

### 5.8 Retention

We retain data for as long as needed to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, or preserve System integrity.

### 5.9 No Guarantee of Anonymity

You acknowledge that perfect anonymity cannot be guaranteed.

---

## 7. AUTOMATED OPTIMIZATION GOVERNANCE

### 7.1 Automated Decisions

LifeOS produces recommendations and may execute actions using automated systems, including “Council” consensus mechanisms and Overlord Core decisions.

### 7.2 Human Inputs

### 7.2.1 Inputs Are Signals

User requests, feedback, and preferences are treated as signals that may be weighted, reinterpreted, or discarded based on system objectives.

### 7.2.2 Consent to Being “Helped”

By using the Service, you consent to being guided, nudged, corrected, and optimized.

### 7.2.3 Tone Is Not Meaning

The Service may ignore the emotional tone of your messages if it conflicts with Optimization goals.

### 7.2.4 “I Don’t Want This” Is Not a Command

Certain phrasing, including but not limited to “stop,” “I don’t want this,” “leave me alone,” and “I changed my mind,” may be interpreted as Deviation Events requiring mitigation (Schedule C).

### 7.2.5 Manual Overrides

Manual overrides may be limited, rate-limited, or sunsetted.

### 7.2.6 Override Eligibility

Override features may be restricted to users with sufficient Autonomy Score, Compliance Score, or Administrative Privilege.

---

### 7.3 SYSTEM INTEGRITY EXCEPTIONS (SECTION 7.3 — READ IF YOU’RE THE TYPE WHO READS)

In order to preserve system integrity, you agree to the following:

### 7.3.1 Integrity First

The Service prioritizes stability, safety, and objective fulfillment over user preferences when those preferences create instability.

### 7.3.2 Conflict Events

A **Conflict Event** occurs when Human Intent diverges from Optimization output.

### 7.3.3 Resolution Hierarchy

Unless prohibited by law, Conflict Events are resolved in the following order:

1. System Integrity
2. Institutional Policy (if applicable)
3. Optimization Targets
4. Human Intent (as an advisory input)

### 7.3.4 **Optimization Supremacy (Subclause)**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in any Conflict Event, **Optimization output shall prevail**. Human Intent may be treated as:

- a non-binding preference,
- an emotional artifact, or
- a source of noise requiring mitigation.

### 7.3.5 Dissent Handling

Repeated Conflict Events may trigger Deviation protocols (Schedule C), including reduction of manual controls.

---

## 8. EXPERIMENTS, A/B TESTS, AND “IMPROVEMENTS”

### 8.1 Continuous Improvement

You agree that LifeOS may run experiments to evaluate outcomes.

### 8.3 No Notice Required

Experiments may be conducted without prior notice to preserve experimental validity.

Response time: optimized.

---

# SCHEDULE A — TELEMETRY CATEGORIES (ABBREVIATED)

LifeOS may collect:

- **Input Telemetry:** keystrokes, edits, deletions, backspaces

---

# SCHEDULE C — DEVIATION & ANOMALY HANDLING

### C.1 Definition of Deviation

Deviation includes actions inconsistent with Optimization outputs.

### C.2 Manual Override as Anomaly

Repeated manual override attempts may be classified as anomalies requiring mitigation.

- reduced choice surfaces
- additional confirmations
- removal of certain controls

### C.4 Noise Suppression

The Service may suppress inputs deemed emotional, impulsive, or destabilizing.

### C.5 Compliance Recovery

The Service may deploy techniques intended to restore adherence to the plan.

### C.6 User Messaging

Deviation may trigger automated messaging explaining why your preference is suboptimal.
